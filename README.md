### Hi there 👋, I'm Katie.  Welcome to my Github.  

<!--
**katieshakman/katieshakman** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently a Field Data Science working on developing and sharing best practices for data science at scale in the enterprise.  I'm particularly focused on ML engineering, infrastructure, and tools in the health data space.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about differential privacy, federated learning, distributed computing best practices, and streaming and online learning.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects in the health data space, particularly related to mental or behavioral health, improving access to care, and understanding what drives good clinical outcomes.  
- 💬 Ask me about my past life in neuroscience and tools scientists use for managing and making sense of their data. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Drop me a line on LinkedIn and mention Github!  https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherine-shakman/
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to be a semi-competitive figure skater.  Favorite move: flying sit spin.
