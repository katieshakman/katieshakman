- I am a Senior Health Data Scientist at Evidation Health, where I work on the Research, Analytics, and Learning team.  
- ðŸ”­ I was previously a Field Data Scientist at Domino Data Lab, where I was solving data science, ML engineering and infrastructure problems, as well as developing and sharing best practices for data science at scale in the enterprise.  I was particularly focused on ML engineering, infrastructure, and tools in the health data space.  
- I earned my PhD in neuroscience from Columbia University and consulted for Therachat as an Insight Health Data Science fellow.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning about differential privacy, federated learning, distributed computing best practices, and streaming and online learning.  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects in the health data space, particularly related to mental or behavioral health, improving access to care, and understanding what drives good clinical outcomes.
